### Dashboard Alternative

The goal is to create a harvest report for all data.json harvest sources. This should be a csv and be a stand-in for [our current application](https://labs.data.gov/dashboard/offices/qa).


Here is a potential endpoint for [pulling all harvest sources](https://catalog.data.gov/api/3/action/package_search?rows=10000&q=type:harvest%20source_type:datajson).


Here is an endpoint example for [one harvest source](https://catalog.data.gov/api/3/action/package_search?q=harvest_source_id:55670d71-b811-4fef-9601-97ff5fcc4ae7).
